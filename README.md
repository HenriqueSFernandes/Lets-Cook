# Let's Cook

## Product Vision

Let's Cook is a revolutionary mobile application designed to connect students within FEUP to buy and sell homemade meals, reducing food waste while fostering a sense of community and culinary exploration. Targeted specifically towards students, Let's Cook addresses the common issue of excess food and tight budgets by providing a platform for convenient and sustainable food sharing.  

Unlike food delivery apps, like Uber Eats and Glovo, that focus on selling restaurant food, Let's Cook is centered around a marketplace for healthy and cheap homemade meals made by students and for students.
