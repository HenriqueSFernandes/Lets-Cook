What we did good:
- Everyone did their job in time.

What we did bad:
- Sometimes the communication wasn't the best.
- Sometimes we forgot to update the status of each project card.

What we are going to start doing:
- Create a branch for every change, even if it's a small change.
- Every pull request needs to have a good description, and 2 reviews are required before merging.
- Each review needs to have a good description, not just a "Good job".
- Everyone needs to know what everyone else is doing.
